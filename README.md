# BinarySearchTreeVisualizer

Welcome to the repo! This web development project is a binary search tree visualizer implemented with Javascript and SVGs. In particular, it allows users to visualize inserting and deleting from a binary search tree, as well as the common tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, and post-order). In future updates, support for balanced/AVL trees and binary heaps is planned to be added.
